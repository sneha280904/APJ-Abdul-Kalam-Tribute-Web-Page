# CODSOFT Task 1 - Linear Regression Model

This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the CODSOFT internship, which involves building a simple linear regression model using Python. The objective is to predict outcomes based on input features using supervised learning techniques.

## Objectives

- Understand the basics of linear regression
- Load and explore the dataset
- Train a simple linear regression model
- Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared
- Visualize the regression line against the data

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Implementation of linear regression using scikit-learn
- Visualization of data points and regression results
- Evaluation of model accuracy and residuals

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sneha280904/CODSOFT-task1.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CODSOFT-task1
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells to view the full analysis, model training, and output.

## Outcome

- A trained linear regression model with visualized predictions
- A step-by-step walkthrough of the regression workflow
- Interpretation of model results and evaluation metrics
